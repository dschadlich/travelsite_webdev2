		An example of a triad color scheme is the <a href="http://www.gbarc.net/">GBARC</a> webpage. The webpage make use of green, blue and red colors on a white background. The coloring provides distinction between the elements, however the coloring of the text makes it difficult at times to read. This is especially the case with the light green text on the white background.

		<p>
		A Monochromatic website is <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> where the colors used are all different shades of the same color. There are some complementary elements that are new on the page, but are only visible on certain elements when they are hovered upon.
		</p>

		<p>
		The Complementary colors are used by <a href="https://www.att.com/shop/wireless.html">ATT Wireless</a> as they use blue and orange colors on their webpage. The text however is difficult to read, not due to coloring, but because of the size.

	Analogous I found the <a href="http://creationfest.com/ne/">CreationFest</a> webpage. They use blues, and purples, and some greens.

		The most aesthetically pleasing site to me is the <a href="http://creationfest.com/ne/">CreationFest</a> webpage. However the <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> website is easier to read. You can tell the slashdot page is focused on the content, and not intending to be flashy. The <a href="http://creationfest.com/ne/">CreationFest</a> colors are attractive to me, and the use of graphics with their scheme ties their page together well.

		I enjoy vacationing by camping at State parks in Vermont. For my color scheme I have chosen to go with green monochromatic coloring. Vermont is known as the green mountain State, and thus green is the color associated with Vermont. I have pulled some of the content from the official Vermont State Parks website. For my background, I have chosen green maple leaves, as they keep with the color scheme, and integrate maples which are also a theme in Vermont. I found the distinction between Analogous and Monochromatic color schemes to be relatively small. My interpretation regarding the difference is it depends on the range of the shades of the colors used.
